# ShowSweep

ShowSweep is a Python utility to identify and manage unwatched TV shows in Plex, with integration for Overseerr, Tautulli, and Sonarr. It helps you keep your TV library clean by safely removing or archiving shows that are no longer needed.

  source .venv/bin/activate
  pip install -r requirements.txt
  ```
- Or use Docker (see below)

### 3. Configure
- Copy `config/example_config.ini` to `config/config.ini` and edit it with your server URLs, API keys, and preferences.

## üõ†Ô∏è Usage

- By default, ShowSweep runs in simulation mode (no files are deleted).
- Use `--skip-confirmation` and `--action` to automate actions.
- All options can be set in `config.ini` or overridden on the command line.

### Example Commands
- Interactive mode:
  ```sh
  python main.py
  ```
- Non-interactive, delete all eligible shows:
  ```sh
  python main.py --skip-confirmation --action delete
  ```
- Force refresh all data:
  ```sh
  python main.py --force-refresh
  ```
- Enable debug logging:
  ```sh
  python main.py --debug
  ```
